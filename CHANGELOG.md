# Changelog

Notable changes to MATERIA, newest first. Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` on `main`.
While the major version is 0, a minor release adds a feature or changes how the
tool is used (file formats, saved projects, CLI flags, API, URLs), and a patch
release fixes bugs.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The Agent remembers an analysis.** Its notes (`write_note`: a gate's
  verdict, an impurity found, a decision of the user's), the cell gate, the
  exceptions the user allowed and the method's stages done are saved with the
  project and autosave, and read back in the next session.
- **Long Agent sessions stay in the window.** With Claude the API clears old
  tool results past 60k tokens (keeping the skills read); a local model gets a
  pruned copy of the history past ~15k tokens.
- **The method's firm rules are enforced, and its stages shown.** On the
  powder page the Agent cannot refine atomic parameters until the cell gate
  has passed for the analysis on screen, and on both pages it cannot refine an
  occupancy with no tie; only the user can lift a rule (`allow_exception`, an
  approval card even in Auto). The drawer shows the method's stages as a
  checklist, done or next, and a refinement out of order says so.
- **The Agent reads its skills when it needs them.** Its system prompt now
  lists the skills (the user's methods) by name and description instead of
  carrying the Rietveld skill and two knowledge bases on every request (about
  6 KB instead of 63 KB, which a local model's context needs). The Agent reads
  a skill with `read_skill`, and the knowledge bases a skill cites only when a
  question needs them; it must read the open page's method before its first
  change there. The skills are the same `.claude/skills` files Claude Code uses,
  so adding a skill needs no code. A PDF skill (`pdf-workflow`) joins the
  Rietveld one, and the Rietveld skill now matches what the app enforces (the
  correlation exemptions, the site ties, phase fractions).
- **Hold the composition** (Shared site row, and the Agent's new
  `set_site_ties`): each element on two or more sites keeps its total in the
  cell, so atoms exchange between sites while the formula stays (anti-site
  disorder, spinel inversion). A normal-spinel start on neutron data of
  MgAl₂O₄ with 22% inversion refined to 0.25(4).
- **Phase fractions.** After a multi-phase powder refinement, each phase's
  weight fraction (Hill–Howard, from its refined scale, cell-contents mass and
  volume, with an esd from the scale esds) shows on the Structure card and in
  the Agent's `get_state` (Mn₃Ga with 3.7 wt% MnO read back 3.65(8) wt%).
- **The Agent runs boxcar scans on the PDF page** (`boxcar_scan`): the free
  parameters refined box by box across r, shown in the Boxcar view, with each
  box's Rw and values returned, to tell the local structure from the average.
- **The cards the Agent is on breathe.** While the Agent is open, the edge of
  each card a running or waiting tool call acts on (Structure, Data,
  Instrument, Pattern, Parameters, Result) breathes, as do the cards a reply
  points to in its last paragraph (for a few seconds) and a reply under the
  pointer. With reduced motion the edge is steady.

### Fixed

- **Occupancy restraints reach the Rietveld fit.** The powder page never sent
  them, so a shared site's occupancies refined with no Σ restraint (the site
  could empty or over-fill) and "Σ occ = 1" did nothing. They now go with
  every nuclear refinement whose occupancies are free, single- or multi-phase.
- **R, wR and GoF describe the data alone.** Restraint pseudo-observations were
  counted in them, which understated wR (by about 3% of its value on a
  restrained spinel fit, and on PDF fits with a shared site).
- **Loading an instrument file first** (before any structure or data) no
  longer blanks the page.
- The Agent's correlation check no longer refuses the Caglioti U, V, W
  together, nor two occupancies one restraint ties: like the background
  coefficients, they move together by construction. The assessment notes them
  once instead of warning per pair, and for a displacement parameter at a
  bound on a shared site it points to the site's mixing first.
- **The cell gate on a sloped 2θ background.** Its Le Bail fit had a flat
  background at constant wavelength, so a lab pattern's slope stayed in the
  residual (wR 50%) and read as unindexed intensity; it now has three
  Chebyshev terms. When unindexed peaks and a violated absence come together,
  the Agent is told the violation may be a line of the same unidentified
  phase, rather than a wrong space group.
- Correlated Lorentzian X and Y widths are explained (they differ only in how
  they grow with angle), like the Caglioti U/V/W.
- **The cell gate on a wide 2θ scan.** Its Le Bail fit used one peak width at
  constant wavelength, so high-angle flanks read as unindexed peaks and a
  correct cell failed (Mn₃Ga 30 K, 5–130°). The width now grows with angle
  (Caglioti U). The gate's unindexed peaks come with d and Q and are marked on
  the plot.
- Excess intensity on nuclear reflections in a neutron pattern of a phase with
  magnetic ions is flagged as possible k = 0 magnetic order, before atoms or
  ADPs are refined into it.
- A CIF without a phase name is named from its common name, formula or data
  block, not "structure".
- The Agent's refine reported the previous history step when the page took
  long to render; switching Ask first / Auto during a run now reaches the
  model at its next turn.
- On the PDF page, the assessment's advice for a displacement parameter at 0
  is about real space (correlated motion, a short window), not Rietveld
  background or absorption; the Agent's bond list names each bond once.
- **Residual peaks are judged against each point's uncertainty and the known
  reflections.** Lone noisy points in a low-count TOF region were reported as
  "unexplained peaks", and so were misfits of a phase's own reflections. Now
  a peak must stand 5σ above its own noise, and each is reported as on a
  reflection, beside one (a shoulder or tail), or unexplained, in the
  assessment, the Agent and the plot marks.
- The assessment reports background-coefficient correlations as one note
  (they are expected), not a warning per pair, and no longer rounds 0.995 to
  1.00.

### Added

- **The Agent never refines correlated parameters together.** Before it
  refines, it measures the free set at the current values with the page's own
  fit; two parameters correlated at |ρ| ≥ 0.95, or a combination the data
  cannot determine, stop the refinement until one of each pair is fixed. The
  approval card shows the strongest pair left; the Refine button is unchanged.
- **The Agent works in any axis unit.** Its fit window can be given in TOF,
  2θ, d or Q and is converted with the page's calibration; positions it
  reports come in d, Q and the data's own axis.
- **The Agent marks unexplained peaks on the Rietveld plot** when it looks for
  them, with a list under the plot to zoom to each and a Clear button.
- **The Agent keeps going when a model stalls.** It notices a reply that
  promises a tool call it does not make, an empty reply after a tool result,
  or "waiting for" a tool that already answered, and asks the model to go on.
  It stops a reply that keeps repeating itself. On LM Studio it loads a model
  with a 32k context before the first message, and refuses one loaded with
  less.
- **The Agent on LM Studio.** A fourth way to reach a model: a local model on
  your LM Studio server (0.4.1 or later, with CORS on), listed from the server
  with each model's loaded context.

### Removed

- **The Agent's Claude Code mode**, with the `materia-live` MCP server, its
  `mcp:live` / `build:mcp-live` scripts and its `.mcp.json` entry. The Agent
  now starts on your own API key; a saved Claude Code choice falls back to it.
  The `materia` MCP server is unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- **The in-app Agent** (#37). A model beside the workbench reads the live powder
  or PDF analysis, judges it with MATERIA's analysis tools, and makes changes
  through the page's own controls. Every change waits for your approval and
  becomes a History step tagged as the agent's, so it can be undone. No tool
  types in a parameter value: the model chooses what to free and when to refine,
  and the least-squares engine sets every value. Four ways to reach a model:
  Claude Code (the `materia-live` MCP server), your Anthropic API key, a local
  proxy on the dev server, or a local model on your Ollama server.
- **Step history** (#13, #14, #24, #26). Go back to any refinement step on the
  powder, single-crystal and PDF pages. The history is a tree, autosaved and
  saved with the project; the step you are on shows beside the back/forward
  arrows.
- **Validation views** (#36): a verdict, residual analysis (powder) and analysis
  of variance (single crystal).
- **S(Q) error propagation** (#28): S(Q) error ribbons, and exact propagation of
  the S(Q) uncertainties to G(r).
- **The cell and space-group gate** (#15): `check_cell_symmetry` refines the cell
  with a Le Bail fit, then checks that every leftover peak indexes and every
  forbidden reflection carries no intensity.
- **MCP tools an LLM can drive** (#10, #12, #16, #25, #30): data travels by
  reference, files by path, and `free` takes globs; the `export_bundle` tool;
  worked examples of an LLM driving the tools, replayed in CI.
- **Layouts** for iPhone, iPad, MacBook and 1K/2K/4K screens (#19). The
  refinement result folds into one collapsible section (#20).
- Refinement convergence is reported as max shift/esd (#23).
- The Mn₃Ga demo opens on a fit window; the MCP magnetic refinement takes moment
  restarts; a compact history card (#21).

### Fixed

- Magnetic dipole form factor: the sign of the ⟨j₂⟩ term (#22).
- Scattering tables, space-group settings, CIF types and reflection truncation
  (#27); CIF tokens, label case, isotopes and symbol-less export (#32).
- FullProf and GSAS-II exports use the right conventions and carry the full
  refined model; TOF sig-q is linear in d (#29). Cross-check bundles carry the
  refined structure (#12).
- Each profile peak fades to zero at its support edge (#18).
- Le Bail: the TOF peak shape, the net-intensity partition, and impurity phases
  in the cell gate (#33).
- A staged refinement that re-fixes a parameter keeps a fit of the values it
  returns (#35).
- The assessment words a held out-of-range value as an input, not a refined one
  (#31).
- Reopening a PDF project restores its last result, and Reset behaves the same
  on every page (#14).
